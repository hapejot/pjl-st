**state**

Answer the value of the state option for the widget.

Specifies one of three states for the button: normal, active, or
disabled. In normal state the button is displayed using the foreground
and background options. The active state is typically used when the
pointer is over the button. In active state the button is displayed
using the activeForeground and activeBackground options. Disabled state
means that the button should be insensitive: the application will refuse
to activate the widget and will ignore mouse button presses.
