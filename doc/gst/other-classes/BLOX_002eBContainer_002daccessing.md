[]{#index-setVerticalLayout_003a}

**setVerticalLayout: aBoolean**

Answer whether the container will align the widgets vertically or
horizontally. Horizontal alignment means that widgets are packed from
left to right, while vertical alignment means that widgets are packed
from the top to the bottom of the widget.

Widgets that are set to be "stretched" will share all the space that is
not allocated to non-stretched widgets.

The layout of the widget can only be set before the first child is
inserted in the widget.
