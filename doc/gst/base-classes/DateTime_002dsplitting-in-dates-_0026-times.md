[]{#index-asTime}

**asTime**

Answer a Time referring to the same time (from midnight) as the receiver

[]{#index-at_003a-2}

Since in the past timestamps were referred to as Arrays containing a
Date and a Time (in this order), this method provides access to DateTime
objects like if they were two-element Arrays.
