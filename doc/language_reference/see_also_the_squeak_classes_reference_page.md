Mousing Around
Squeak (and the Smalltalk-80 from which it was spawned) assumes a machine with a three-button mouse (or its equivalent). These buttons were 
referred to as "red," "yellow" and "blue." The red button was conventionally used for selecting "things," the yellow button was conventionally
used for manipulating "things" within a window and the blue button was conventionally used for manipulating windows themselves. Conventions, 
of course, are not always followed.
Since many modern mice no longer have three buttons, let alone colored ones, various mapping conventions are used:
For uncolored three-button mice, the usual mapping is:
left-mouse
-> red
middle-mouse -> yellow
right-mouse -> blue
Windows machines with three button mice can be made to conform to this mapping by right clicking the Windows 
title bar of Squeak, and selecting >>  Otherwise, for Windows 
machines with two button mice, the mapping is:
VM Preferences Use 3 button mouse mapping.
left-mouse -> red
right-mouse -> yellow
alt-left-mouse -> blue
MacOS Systems generally have one mouse button. The mapping is:
mouse -> red
option-mouse -> yellow
-mouse
 -> blue
It is worthwhile purchasing a 3-button mouse for your computer. I put colored labels on my buttons while I was
training my fingers. I also chose a different mapping.
If you have a mouse with a scrolling wheel, map "wheel up" to command-upArrow and "wheel down" to command-downArrow, and you will be 
able to use the wheel to control scrolling in Squeak.
