System Menus
Squeak provides access to certain Smalltalk services through its system menus, some of which are depictedbelow:
. The World menu, sometimes called the "main menu," can be reached by clicking the red button while the mousepoints to the 
background of a system project. From this menu, you can save the image and changes files, save them in files with a different name, and terminate 
execution of the Squeak virtual machine. You can also access many other menus ... including the four shown here.
The Main Menu
 provides access to many system tools, including system browsers, workspaces, change sorters, transcripts and file lists, as well  
as end user tools such as an email agent ( ) and web browser ( ).

System Key Bindings
Applications that use standard Squeak text container widgets, including System Browsers, Workspaces, File Lists and Transcripts, provide 
facilities for manipulating the text and providing access to other system functionality. Many of these facilities can be reached by using the red-
button menus, but many are more conveniently accessed using special key sequences. Of course, particular applications can use some, all or of 
none of these. In the following tables, a lower-case or numeric command "key" can be typed by simultaneously pressing the key and the Alt key
(on Windows) or the key (on MacOS). Upper-case keys are typed by simultaneously pressing either Shift-Alt (or Shift- ) and the ind icated 
key,  ctrl and the indicated key. Other special key presses are indicated below in square brackets.
