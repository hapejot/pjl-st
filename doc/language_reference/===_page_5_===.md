Smalltalk Program Data Entry
Key Description Notes
q Attempt to complete the selection with a valid and defined Smalltalk selector. Repeated 
commands yield additional selectors.  
r Recognizer. Invoke the Squeak glyph character recognizer. (Terminate recognition by mousing out
of the window)
 
F Insert 'ifFalse:'  
T Insert 'ifTrue:'  
V Paste author's initials, date and time.  
L Outdent (move selection or line one tab-stop left)  
R Indent (move selection or line one tab stop right)  
[Ctl-return] Insert return followed by as many tabs as the previous line (with a further adjustment for
additional brackets in that line)  
[shift-delete] Forward delete. Or, deletes from the insertion point to the beginning of the current word.  
Bracket Keys
These keys are used to enclose (or un-enclose, if the selection is already enclosed) the selection in a kind of "bracket". Conveniently, double 
clicking just inside any bracketed text selects the entire text, but not the brackets.
